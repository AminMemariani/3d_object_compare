# 🚨 CRITICAL: Run This Now

## The Problem
The file picker isn't opening, which means either:
1. The entitlements aren't being applied
2. The file_picker plugin has an issue
3. macOS system permissions are blocking it

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP: Do This Exactly

### Step 1: Run the rebuild script

```bash
cd /Users/cyberhonig/FlutterProjects/flutter_3d_compare
./rebuild_and_run.sh
```

### Step 2: When the app opens

1. **Click the "Object A" button**
2. **IMMEDIATELY look at the terminal/console**

### Step 3: What to look for in console

You should see these 🔴 RED debug messages FIRST:

```
🔴 DEBUG: _loadObjectA called - button click IS working!
🔴 DEBUG: About to call viewModel.loadObjectA()
```

Then you should see these 📁 messages from the file picker:

```
📁 [START] Opening file picker for Object A...
📁 Platform: Native
📁 [PICKER RETURNED] Result: NULL or NOT NULL
```

## 📊 Diagnostic Results

### Scenario A: You see 🔴 messages but NO 📁 messages
**Problem:** Provider isn't working or viewModel isn't being called
**Action:** Share the exact console output

### Scenario B: You see NO 🔴 messages at all
**Problem:** Button click isn't working at all
**Action:** The InkWell/onTap might be blocked by another widget

### Scenario C: You see all messages but `[PICKER RETURNED] Result: NULL`
**Problem:** Entitlements not applied or macOS permissions denied
**Action:** We need to build from Xcode directly

### Scenario D: You see `[PICKER ERROR]` with an exception
**Problem:** file_picker plugin issue
**Action:** Share the exact error message

## 🆘 If the script doesn't work

Run manually:

```bash
cd /Users/cyberhonig/FlutterProjects/flutter_3d_compare

# Clean everything
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run with maximum verbosity
flutter run -d macos -v 2>&1 | tee flutter_run.log
```

Then:
1. Click "Object A" button
2. Save the output: The file `flutter_run.log` will have everything
3. Search in that file for any lines with 🔴 or 📁
4. Share those lines with me

##  Alternative: Open in Xcode

If Flutter run doesn't work, open in Xcode directly:

```bash
open macos/Runner.xcworkspace
```

Then:
1. Click the Play button in Xcode to build and run
2. Click "Object A" when app opens
3. Look at Xcode console for the 🔴 and 📁 messages

---

**Please run `./rebuild_and_run.sh` now and share what you see in the console when you click Object A!** 🚀
