## 🚀 Major Release Highlights

This is the first stable release of the **3D Object Comparison Tool**, a professional-grade Flutter application designed for researchers, professionals, and developers in **geology**, **gaming**, and **medical fields**. The platform enables advanced 3D object comparison using Procrustes analysis with comprehensive scientific metrics.

### 🍎 **Recommended Platform: macOS**
For optimal performance and full 3D rendering support with native point cloud visualization for all file formats.

## ✨ New Features

### 🎨 **Native 3D Rendering (macOS)**
- **CustomPainter-based point cloud rendering** for all formats (OBJ, STL, GLTF, GLB)
- **Interactive 3D visualization** with mouse drag rotation and scroll zoom
- **Perspective projection** with depth-based visualization
- **No WebView dependency** - Direct native rendering
- **Excellent performance** with large models (10K+ vertices)

### 🔬 **Scientific Analysis Engine**
- **Procrustes Analysis** with statistical alignment
- **Scientific Metrics Display**:
  - Minimum Distance
  - Standard Deviation  
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Transformation Matrix
- **Vertex-based Analysis** using actual 3D mesh data
- **High-precision calculations** for research-grade results

### 📁 **Comprehensive File Format Support**
- **OBJ** - Wavefront format with full vertex parsing
- **STL** - Binary and ASCII stereolithography support
- **GLTF** - JSON-based with embedded/external binary data
- **GLB** - Binary GLTF container format
- **Unified Parser Architecture** with extensible factory pattern

### 📊 **Advanced Export System**
- **TXT Export** with complete analysis reports
- **Comprehensive Logging** - All processing steps captured
- **Scientific Data Export** - CSV with prioritized metrics
- **Share Integration** - Easy report sharing across platforms

### 🎯 **Streamlined User Experience**
- **Smart Compare Button** - Disabled until both objects loaded
- **Object Reset on Navigation** - Fresh start for each comparison
- **Clean Interface** - Removed redundant UI elements
- **Tutorial System** - Interactive onboarding for new users

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Quick Start (macOS - Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AminMemariani/3d_object_compare.git
cd 3d_object_compare

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
