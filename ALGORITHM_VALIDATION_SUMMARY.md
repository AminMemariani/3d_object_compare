## 🎯 Key Findings

### Test 1: Self-Comparison Validation
```
Purpose: Verify algorithm correctness with identical objects
Result: 100% similarity - PERFECT identification
Conclusion: Algorithm correctly identifies identical objects
```

### Test 2: Different Models Comparison
```
Purpose: Compare two different skull models
Result: 88.55% similarity - HIGH similarity detected
Conclusion: Algorithm correctly identifies both:
  - That objects are DIFFERENT (not 100%)
  - That they share structural features (high score)
  - Biological interpretation: Both are human skulls
```

### Test 3: Scale-Invariant Analysis
```
Purpose: Test scale normalization
Result: 98.35% similarity (up from 88.55%)
Conclusion: Main difference was SCALE, not shape
  - Size difference: ~4x in each dimension
  - Shape similarity: 98.35% (excellent match)
```

## 🎓 Interpretation Guide

| Similarity Score | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 100% | Perfect match / Identical objects |
| 95-99% | Extremely similar (same object, minor variations) |
| 85-95% | Very similar (same category, different instances) |
| 70-85% | Similar (recognizable similarities) |
| 50-70% | Moderate similarity |
| <50% | Different objects |

**Our Results:**
- ✅ Test 1 (100%): Perfect - as expected for self-comparison
- ✅ Test 2 (88.55%): Very similar - makes sense for two human skulls
- ✅ Test 3 (98.35%): Extremely similar shapes after scale normalization
