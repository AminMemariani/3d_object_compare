## 🐛 Known Issues

### Platform Limitations
- [ ] macOS desktop: WebView not implemented for ModelViewer (shows placeholder)
  - **Workaround:** Use `flutter run -d chrome` for full 3D rendering
  - **Status:** Platform limitation, cannot fix
  
### Performance
- [ ] Large models (>10,000 vertices) may slow down analysis
  - **Current:** Auto-sampling to 2,000 vertices
  - **Impact:** Minor accuracy reduction, major performance gain

### File Format Limitations
- [ ] GLTF with external .bin files may not load correctly on web
  - **Current:** Handles embedded base64 data
  - **Impact:** Some complex GLTF files won't load

- **Medium models (1K-10K vertices):** 1-3 seconds
- **Large models (10K+ vertices):** 3-5 seconds

### Memory Usage
- **Per model:** ~5-10 MB (depending on vertex count)
- **During analysis:** +20-30 MB (temporary allocations)
- **Typical total:** 50-100 MB
