# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issues

### 1. CI/CD Badge Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: Badge was pointing to "Build and Test" workflow
- **Fix**: Updated to point to "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- **Status**: Fixed in latest commit

### 2. 404 Page Still Exists ❌
- **Issue**: Site still returns 404 at `https://aminmemariani.github.io/3d_object_compare/`
- **Possible Causes**:
  - GitHub Pages not configured to use GitHub Actions
  - GitHub Actions workflow not running
  - Deployment failing silently
  - GitHub Pages settings incorrect

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: `https://github.com/AminMemariani/3d_object_compare/settings/pages`
2. Verify:
   - **Source**: Should be "GitHub Actions"
   - **Status**: Should show "Your site is published at..."
   - **Custom domain**: Should be empty (no custom domain)

### Step 2: Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to: `https://github.com/AminMemariani/3d_object_compare/actions`
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Check if it's:
   - ✅ **Completed successfully** (green checkmark)
   - ⏳ **Still running** (yellow circle)
   - ❌ **Failed** (red X)

### Step 3: Manual Deployment (If Needed)
If GitHub Actions isn't working, we can deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the app locally
flutter build web --release

# Deploy using the script
./scripts/deploy_web.sh
```

## 🎯 Expected Configuration

### GitHub Pages Settings:
- **Source**: GitHub Actions
- **Workflow**: Deploy to GitHub Pages
- **URL**: `https://aminmemariani.github.io/3d_object_compare/`

### GitHub Actions Workflow:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Steps**: Install → Test → Build → Deploy

## 🚀 Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Reconfigure GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Change source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Save, then change back to "GitHub Actions"
5. Save again

### Option B: Manual Deployment
Run the deployment script to create the gh-pages branch manually:
```bash
./scripts/deploy_web.sh
```

### Option C: Check Workflow Permissions
1. Go to repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Ensure "Workflow permissions" is set to "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ **Code**: All changes pushed to main branch
- ✅ **Workflow**: GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ **Badge**: CI/CD badge fixed
- ❌ **Deployment**: Site still showing 404
- ❌ **GitHub Pages**: May need manual configuration

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Check GitHub Pages settings** (most likely issue)
2. **Verify GitHub Actions permissions**
3. **Monitor Actions tab** for workflow status
4. **Try manual deployment** if needed

The deployment should work once GitHub Pages is properly configured to use GitHub Actions as the source.
