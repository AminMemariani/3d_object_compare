## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Quick Start (macOS - Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AminMemariani/3d_object_compare.git
cd 3d_object_compare

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on macOS
flutter run -d macos

# Load your 3D models and start comparing!
```

### **Basic Workflow**
1. **Load Objects**: Use "Load Object A" and "Load Object B" buttons
2. **Navigate to Comparison**: Automatically opens when both objects loaded
3. **Run Analysis**: Click "Run Procrustes Analysis" for scientific metrics
4. **Export Results**: Save complete analysis report with logs as TXT file
